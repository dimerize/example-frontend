# Example CSS Styling

## Description
This is my CSS styled version of the app-template quote generator frontend. I modified the appearance of most of the components and added various `element:hover` effects and implemented Flexbox styling throughout the application to make the app more responsive to user interaction.

The frontend in its current state is incompatible with the app-template's backend and Mongo database (due to some modifications I made to the React code), which is why I created this repository to host and display the CSS styling.

## QuickStart
```
$ cd ./template-frontend && npm install && npm run start
```
