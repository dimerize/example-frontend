# Example CSS Styling

## Description
This is my CSS styled version of the [app-template](https://github.com/mskcc/app-template) quote generator frontend. 

I modified the appearance of most of the components and added various `element:hover` effects and implemented Flexbox styling throughout to make the application more responsive to user interaction.

The frontend in its current state is incompatible with the app-template's backend and Mongo database (due to some modifications I made to the React code), which is why I created this repository to host and display the CSS styling.

## QuickStart
```
$ cd ./template-frontend && npm install && npm run start
```
